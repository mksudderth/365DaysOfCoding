# 365DaysOfCoding
My Year of Coding 

Rules:

1. Spend 1 hour every day coding
2. Tutorials will count towards the hour as long as I am writing code; watching videos and doing nothing doesn't count
3. Time spent coding at work will also count (I'll probably not upload some of those projects)
4. I can skip days provided I do something productive/helpful/positive
5. To the best of my ability, I'll tweet and give a short summary about my projects
6. I will attempt to learn more than one programming language
